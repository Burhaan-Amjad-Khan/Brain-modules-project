# 🧠 Brain MRI Disease Detection App

This Streamlit web application predicts brain-related diseases from MRI images using a deep learning model trained on medical imaging data.

## 🔍 Overview

This project uses a PyTorch-based convolutional neural network to classify uploaded brain MRI images as either:

- **Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

The model has been trained and exported as a `.pth` file and is integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

## 🧠 Use Case

This AI tool helps doctors and radiologists:
- Quickly identify brain tumors.
- Support second-opinion diagnosis.
- Reduce diagnostic delays.
